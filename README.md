## Overview
Angela has request some metrics on the the performance of The Paper Compnay's newer product lines for non-paper office supplies. Angelia is the Head of Finance and wants to identify a few areas that you can improve and what your best selling products are. She wants a report by Monday morning with recommendations.

## Built With
Tableau

## Features
This BI dashboard consists of 5 worksheets: 
 - KPIs Sheet - Three high level key performance indicators: Revenue, Units, and Unit Price
 - Revenue Trend Sheet - A trend of Revenue, broken down by region in order to add more context to the KPIs.
 - Revenue by Item Sheet - A heatmap which breaks down the items sold by region.
 - Revenue by Sales Rep Sheet - A scatterplot which illustrates the number of units sold and revenue brought in by each sales rep.
 - Unit Price by Region Sheet - A modified bar chart that breaks down how average unit price varies across different regions.
These 5 worksheets were then assembled into a Z pattern dashborad. The Z pattern dashboard was then used in building a story that provides the finance team with a high level dashboard, a view of the top performing sales people, and a view of the lowest performing sales people. This final version answers Angela's question more directly by providing a few interesting views.
